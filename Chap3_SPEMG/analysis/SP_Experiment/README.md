About the notebooks : 
- Notebook 0 shows the trimming performed on the data prior to the data analysis
- Notebook 1 analyses the results of the LMMs on behavioral and EMG chronometric variables
- Notebook 2a and 2b test for factor effect on the slope and baseling of the EMG signal for each trial
- Noteboook 3 fits a DDM and tests for the effect of the probability manipulation on the starting point of the DDM
