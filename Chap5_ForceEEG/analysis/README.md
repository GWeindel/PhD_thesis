0-data_MT_N200_merge_filtering.ipynb contains the code used to merge MT, PMT and N200 estimates and performs the data trimming prior to the analysis

Summary.ipynb contains the code used for the result section in the chapter, (I expect to comment a bit more in the near future...)

As of 27 Feb. 2021 the mixed_models and DDM code are not yet available as I temprarily lost access to the cluster used for the fit. But these files will be made available as soon as possible.
